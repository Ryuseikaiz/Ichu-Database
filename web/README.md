# I-Chu Card Database

A web application to browse, search, and filter cards from the **I-Chu** game. Data is crawled from the [I-Chu Wiki](https://ichu.fandom.com/).

## Features

- **Card Gallery**: View cards in Grid or List/Table mode.
- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Filter by Skill Type (Score, Perfect, Healer, PLock, etc.).
  - Search by Name.
- **Stats Viewer**: Toggle between Unidolized, Idolized, and **Etoile+5** stats.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: React source code.
- `src/data/ichu_cards.json`: The dataset used by the app (generated by the crawler).
- `crawl_ichu.py`: Python script to crawl data from the wiki.

## Getting Started
